# multi-step_form
## I coded this in PHP and JS mainly.  JS has the error-checking.  It has a MySQL database.
## This was developed for a client, and wanted to share it with anyone that needs a multi-screen form to write data to your database.
### You need to create the database first or you will see 500 error.
### Table data is displayed in the database file, which is just a text file.
